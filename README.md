# Next.js 15 - Silent File System Errors on App Startup

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 where file system errors during application initialization can lead to unexpected crashes without clear error messages.

## Problem

A seemingly simple Next.js application might fail to start due to file system problems (permissions, disk space, etc.) without providing useful error messages in the console or logs. This makes debugging challenging.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run the application using `npm run dev`.
3. **Simulate a file system error:**  You may need to manually introduce a file system issue (e.g., fill up your disk space, change permissions) to trigger the bug.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling to catch file system exceptions. The improved version includes error handling and logging to provide better diagnostics.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling, especially when dealing with external resources like the file system in a framework like Next.js.
